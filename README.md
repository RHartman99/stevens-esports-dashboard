# CS-546 Final Project

## About

### Introduction:

As a Non-RSO (Registered Student Organization) at Stevens Institute of Technology, Stevens Esports serves as the organizing body for intercollegiate competitive gaming on campus. The club aims to support its members by bolstering their competitive careers and providing an organized means of competing in amateur collegiate leagues. They currently host over 80 student players across a wide variety of titles and fosters teams that often place in the top 25% of schools across the nation. To help facilitate growth and maintain organization, the Stevens Esports Club is interested in a central means of organizing rosters, match schedules, and other logistical information for the club. Given this unique set of requirements, we propose building a dashboard that can offer the functionality the club requires, that can be deployed and put to use in a production environment after the conclusion of the semester.

### Motivation:

Currently, other than the official Stevens Esports Discord server, there is no centralized hub of information about Stevens Esports or its teams/games. This dashboard will serve as not only an information hub for the players, but it will also allow the club eBoard members to manage their rosters. This website will also allow users to sign up and submit an application should they want to play for a team in the club.
In addition, there is no one place that records the history of the games the teams play, nor is there a centralized schedule for upcoming matches. Oftentimes, players could be playing on teams for different games, and itâ€™s a hassle to find information on upcoming matches so they can schedule around the games. With a centralized information hub, players will be able to view their upcoming matches and schedule events around the games ahead of time.
